# ATTN GRADER:

### FLASHING COLORS WARNING
[Live Demo](http://dj.github.io/dancingBMO/)

I tried to make it less blinding right before the dealine, sorry ):

### Languages

I wrote this in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), which is just really syntactic sugar over javascript. The javascript it produces is legible, if a bit verbose so I would recommend reading the CoffeeScript if you prefer python/ruby/haskell syntax to js/java/c++ syntax.

### Firefox Version

https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/32.0.3/releasenotes/
This is the only browser I've tested it with, but any modern browser should work

### To run

Clone the repo and open index.html
